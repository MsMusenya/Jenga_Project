Final project, fun QnA-get to know Kenya
### **Learn about Kenya from a Kenya**

- They say the best way to learn is practically, learning in reverse. 
- Here we don't start with the nuggets but rather the questions
- Don't worry, if you get it wrong you'll still get to learn since the solution will be given
- In Kenya, we have the concept of "Nyumba Kumi" which directly translated to 10 houses. It is an initiative which was started of in Kenya to encourage the locals a to constantly interact and share information about one another.
- It was put into effect in 2013 as a measure against crime and terrorism in communities.
- However, we will borrow the spirit it embodies(sharing information about oneself) in order to overcome the myths the international community has in regards to Kenya.
- Here, you get to learn from a native who is born, raised and bred in Kenya(though curious about Europe and would love to experience the places like the natives do)
- Whatever you know, some are true and while others are just far fetched.
- This project aims to shed a white light over all the information you have while adding a few more that you may not know but definitely should.
- Buckle up, this is going to be one fun ride. I had so much fun coming up with this and I hope you have just as much learning
